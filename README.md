# Parallel GTFS Workflow
A replicable workflow (i.e., data pipeline) for parallel processing of GTFS (real-time + static) data to calculate various transit metrics using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data engineering techniques. 

**PLEASE NOTE** - The original code is undergoing modifications (e.g., better documentation) and will be published in increments over time - the entire repo is projected to be complete by Spring 2022.

## Motivation
COVID-19 has revealed the entire world of how fragile our essential infrastructure is and has reminded us that system adaptation and resilience are crucial (OECD, 2021; Sneader and Lund, 2020). Essential infrastructure is defined as basic necessities that are crucial to the well-being and convenience of the general public. These include basic hygience, healthcare, emergency personnel, clean water, basic hygiene, fresh groceries, energy, communications, and transportation. All of these elements are interlinked and maintains the global economy and modern life. In the current timeline of rapid population growth, especially mass migrations to cities, and climate change/chaos, the need for resilience and adaptability is a must. Therefore, this research and development project presents a replicable workflow that intends to cover both of these needs in the context of urban public transit services.
