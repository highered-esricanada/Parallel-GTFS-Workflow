About: 2 Classes with their own unique purpose.
	a) BridgeVehRestSeg - Converts the coordinate pairs that have been queried into an appropriate
						  format to build Polyline geometry.
					    - Used in the PrepareSeg Class for consecutive pair connection type: in-between and one-stop.
					    - Used individually for consecutive pair connection type: same stop.

	b) PrepareSeg       - Converts the coordinate pairs that have been queried into an appropriate
						  format to build Polyline geometry via BridgeVehRestSeg.
						- Builds the segment paths from 1st veh        --> stop_seque
														nth stop_seque --> 2nd veh.
						- Calculates distance of each segment path (1st veh --> stop seque; nth stop seque --> 2nd veh.)
